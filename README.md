my github account is a play off of my name.
The repository I created was on the website of Github, Than i cloned it from the internet onto my local drive So i can edit the contents. 
I cloned my repository using the clone repository option and made sure it was in the right drive in the correct folder because it will be used again. this was fun and I like the challenge.
This was actually a bit of a challenge for me because I hate using txt. files and have already gotten used to using Python. It was quite easy after using the tutorial on the github desktop application because you also learn the hotkeys. This is especially important for getting work done quick.
I will now push the new changes I made through the desktop app using by saving this file but not closing it. using the ctrl/shift/ A command, will make my fiel appear and let me commit the changes after submitting a description and summary I will push it through witht he ctrl P shortcut. this is the foundation of coding. It took me a while to figure this out, 3 hours but I am very determined. Thanks for the challenge Professor! this is a test.
